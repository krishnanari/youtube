YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing


Introduction
YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project aimed at developing a user-friendly Streamlit application that leverages the power of the Google API to extract valuable information from YouTube channels. The SQL database will be used to create tables and make them accessible for analysis and exploration within the Streamlit app.

Key Technologies and Skills
1.	Python scripting
2.	Data Collection
3.	API integration
4.	Streamlit
5.	Data Management using SQL


Installation:
To run this project, you need to install the following packages:
1.	pip install mysql-connector-python
2.	pip install pandas
3.	pip install google-api-python-client
4.	pip install streamlit
5.	pip install requests-cache




Features
 Retrieve data from the YouTube API, including channel information, playlists, videos, and comments.
 Store the retrieved data in a SQL database.
 Analyze data using Streamlit
 Perform queries on the SQL data warehouse.
 Gain insights into channel performance, video metrics, and more.



Retrieving data from the YouTube API:
The project utilizes the Google API to retrieve comprehensive data from YouTube channels. The data includes information on channels, playlists, videos, and comments. By interacting with the Google API, we collect the data and merge it into a JSON file.

Store the retrieved data in a SQL database:
Users can choose which channel's data to migrate. To ensure compatibility with a structured format, the data is cleansed using the powerful pandas library. Following data cleaning, the information is segregated into separate tables, including channels, playlists, videos, and comments, utilizing SQL queries.

Data Analysis
The project provides comprehensive data analysis capabilities using Streamlit. users can create interactive gain insights from the collected data.

Channel Analysis:
Channel analysis includes insights on playlists, videos, subscribers, views, likes, comments, and durations. Gain a deep understanding of the channel's performance and audience engagement through detailed summaries.

Video Analysis:
Video analysis focuses on views, likes, dislike, comments, and durations enabling both an overall channel and specific channel perspectives.
